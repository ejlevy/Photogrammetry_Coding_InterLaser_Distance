# Photogrammetry_Coding_InterLaser_Distance
This repository contains the annotated code to implement the ImageJ and skimage methods to automate the measurement of inter-laser distance in parallel-laser photogrammetry images. These methods are presented in our publication in Mammalian Biology (Richardson &amp; Levy et al, in revision)
