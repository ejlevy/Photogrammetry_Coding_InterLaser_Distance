### Annotated code
# Below is the annotated code. Each line is followed by a description of what that line does and any adjustments you might need to make when adapting for your study system. These annotations are marked by a pound sign.

imageName = getTitle();
# Centers the script on the image that it's about to process

//setTool("rectangle");
# Selects the rectangle tool. 
# You could perform this auto-crop with other tools, eg oval tool
# If using hand-cropped images, delete this line

makeRectangle(1662, 924, 1620, 540);
# Creates a rectangle that will encompass the laser spots 
# You can make this rectangle smaller (see Recording macro below)
# If using hand-cropped images, delete this line

run("Crop");
# Crops the image to the coordinates indicated by previous line
# If using hand-cropped images, delete this line

run("Set Measurements...", "area centroid bounding display invert redirect=None decimal=3");
# This was not necessary when processing baboon images, but was needed when processing hand-cropped gorilla images.
# Under some conditions, ImageJ will flip the y-axis in the final coordinates unless this line is included
# If the y-axis is not flipping, including this line is unnecessary but it will not change your measurements if you include it

run("Split Channels");
# Splits the image into red, green, and blue channels

imageCalculator("Subtract create", imageName + " (green)", imageName + " (red)")
# Subtracts the red channel from the green channel

setAutoThreshold("Default dark");

//run("Threshold...");
# Performs an automatic light threshold, separating pixels into white or black.
# If the script is working, you will see white or red dots where the laser points were.
# We use following inputs and buttons:
  # Default & Red
  # Dark background checked
  # Click Auto

run("Analyze Particles...", "display exclude summarize add");
# Record the coordinates of the dots.
# We use the pre-set inputs: 
  # Size (pixel^2): 0-Infinity; Circularity: 0.00-1.00 
  # Show: Nothing, though this is flexible.
  # Display results, Summarize, Add to Manager, Exclude on edges
